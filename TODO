TODO
   - Get ride of helpers.
   - Use separate script files (at least for dev- with phing joining them togeter on build)
   - Implement pause. Catch interrups/events. (I think events/interrups would be catched by curl instead of our script)

   [done] Remove phing dependency - use another build script
   [done] `dynamic` param to update list as it is updated on disk. Ignore already downloaded items on list.
   [done] Use different download.lst, success, failed etc. when they are generated automatically (ie: when using --file)
   [done] Pass params to curl.
   [done] Use an index to start downloads from a given item on the list, or download from a given offset a determined number of files. --offset 1,13 (from 1 to 13), --offset 5 (from 5th item)
   [done] Play sounds on different events like download completion, fail, and etc, or use kmessagebox.
   [done] Download with a given pattern. Example: *.mpg -- solved passing params to curl or with curl items. I think curl can handle it without further changes.
   [done] Use the format: --param=value for parameters
   [done] Recursive listing (open url and sub folders on there). Limit recursion level. ie: --recursion-deep 5
   [done] Modularize the code. Use functions.
   [done] Use exit codes to say if some download items had failed.
   [done] Better parameters handling (such perl's Opt::More)
   [done] Download file list (directory listing)
   [done] Accept parameters to perform some actions such:
       * create download list from a directory listing.
       x check only operations (file sizes)
   [done] Add support for single file download: dumpr.sh file http://sdf/file.avi

BUGS
   [open]
   - Doesn't show proxy settings correctly (when no proxy uses it doesn't display anything; when there is a proxy settings enabled it shows "(No proxy)")
   - Doesn't create /tmp/dumpr folder. Fails to create tmp list if folder doesn't exists.
   [closed]
   - It doesn't display the proxy used.
   - Use local variables next time:
   Downloading http://zend-sdk.googlecode.com/files/eclipse-php-3.0.2.v2011102768-x86.tar.gz (1)

   curl: (6) Couldn't resolve host '(No'

   curl: (6) Couldn't resolve host 'proxy)'
   - It seems the "total items" count if wrong by one when counting items from a
   list. (shows "2" when there are three items)

   - MD5sum fails to hash the files with spaces in their name, ie: image 4.jpg.

   It tries to hash "imgage" and "4.jpg". Have to add quotes around it.

   - When passing an url target the script creates directories for the given url:
   ie: http://target/url/list ->
   mkdir -p http:/target/url/list

   [fixed] MD5 of files doesn't work:
       The destination param provokes the md5sum program to fail to find files to hash:
       md5sum /path/to/./dest/dir/file.avi

   [featured-removed] Status is not really helpful:
        Should show more verbose information:
           * current file being downloaded
           * number of tries for current file
           * downloaded from the file (0 on first try, if fail, its updated, but can't be updated on real time)
           * total downloaded files, completed downloads
           * failed downloads
           * remaining downloads
           * current directory size.

   [by-design] Variable expansion doesn't work: dump.sh . -- conf
       destination = ".";
       By default all params should be expanded.
